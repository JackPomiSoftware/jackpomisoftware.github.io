    <h6>How to open an applet?</h6>
    <div class="smalltext">
        <p>To open an applet, you should first select it in the applets panel. The description panel will then display the information about what can this applet change in your system settings. To open the applet, click a button that will appear in the bottom right corner of the description panel. The applet is opened. Some applets will open after a few seconds, that depends on how many settings they need to load.</p>
